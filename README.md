Spamming randomized nonsense data against Redline stealers' C&amp;C servers.  

## Brief intro
I encountered a Redline password stealer sample that was being distributed by malicious entities using seemingly compromised Discord accounts.

This script spams randomly generated offsensive data to the C&C server of the malware sample described above.  
  
## WARNING(1): Do NOT use/modify this tool against innocent websites.
I uploaded the script just for ppls to spam malicious sites only, in effort of taking those scumbags down or at least rendering their service unavailable.
  
## WARNING(2): Source code contains offensive words and phrases.
The random messages pool contains extremely offensive and rude words. I am NOT endorsing ANY kind of behaviors described in those insulting sentences. Those are just used to make the perpetrators extra mad.  
  
## Usage
`node /path/to/directory/of/package`  
  
You should run this script ONLY under sandboxed environments with proper VPN settings. Node.js >= 11.7.0 is required.
